        <b><i> Favorite CMSC Subject </i></b>
        <br>
        <b>CMSC 22</b> would be the winner in the many lists of CMSC subjects.
        I enjoyed learning the language of Java and coding in Eclipse!
        The topic of OOP is also tricky yet fun to visualize.

        <b><i>Favorite GE</i></b>
        <br>
        <b>HIST 1</b> made me learn so much of the importance in valuing history,
        and how it influences the events in the present. I took the subject during the recent
        elections, and it was interesting to learn ideas and explanations that explain the 
        current behavior of Filipinos.

        <b><i>Favorite Programming Language</i></b>
        <br>
        <b>Java</b> would take the crown of being my favorite PL since I like how long
        its syntax are and it makes me feel like a programming god when coding in Java.

        <b><i>Favorite Food</i></b>
        <br>
        My dad's <b>Kare-kare</b> is always my go-to ulam, but today I am currently
        craving foods from <b>Chubby Habbi's</b>.
